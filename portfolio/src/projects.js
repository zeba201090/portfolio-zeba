I created the user interface with HTML, CSS, and EJS templates, connecting it to the backend using RESTful APIs. The backend, built with Node.js and Express.js, focused on making it easy to create, read, update, and delete data through these APIs. I integrated bKash Sandbox for online payments, NodeMailer for email confirmations, and generated dynamic PDFs for bills and tickets. I also ensured security with input validation and proper error handling of corner cases in the backend. The code is written following MVC . I have also created documentation guides for users, admins, and developers, including a detailed API guide.",

  The projects you see here are from my early side projects as a student. Now, I work remotely with <span class="font-bold">MERN stack</span> technologies for well-known brands in the <span class="font-bold">UK</span>, <span class="font-bold">US</span>, and <span class="font-bold">Canada</span>. My main focus is on building <span class="font-bold">configurable systems</span> and <span class="font-bold">authentication solutions</span> for a variety of clients, including <span class="font-bold">government product sellers</span>. Each project involves careful <span class="font-bold">system and database architecture</span> to ensure the solutions are both efficient and scalable. In addition to backend work, I also explore <span class="font-bold">AR/VR development</span> and <span class="font-bold">3D modeling</span>, creating immersive experiences and visualizing complex data in creative ways. Iâ€™m always working to optimize performance, ensuring that systems are <span class="font-bold">fast, reliable, and secure</span>, even when managing large amounts of data.
